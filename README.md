Unsplash used to be great! But since they introduced their new Unsplash+ service, browsing it has become a bit of a pain as it's now crowded with watermarked images blocked behind a pay wall. This extension aims to improve your Unsplash experience and get you more productive by getting rid of all that bloat. By turning Minus for Unsplash on, you will no longer see watermarked Unsplash+ images in your feed and will be able to focus on those that matter.
